    <h2>Problem:</h2>   
          
        <p>
        Millions of dyslexic children face barriers in education due to reading, writing, and spelling difficulties. <br>
        Existing apps often fail to meet the unique needs of dyslexic learners, leading to ongoing challenges in comprehension and engagement. <br>
        There is a gap in functionality and accessibility in current assistive technologies and educational interventions for dyslexic individuals.<br>
    </p>


    <h2>Goals:</h2>

    <p>
         Reading and Writing Skills: <br>

         Hierarchical Task Analysis: <br>
    
        1. Select reading material <br>
    
        2. Choose desired reading mode (e.g., text, audio) <br>
    
        3. Read or listen to the material <br>
    
        4. Practice writing exercises <br>
    
        5. Utilize spell-check and predictive text features <br>
    
        6. Seek feedback from parents or educators <br>

    </p>


    <h2>Problem Scenario:</h2>

        <p> Mia, a young dyslexic learner, expresses a desire to manage her learning activities more independently. Her father, Tom, introduces her to the XR Dyslexia Companion App, highlighting its user-friendly interface and diverse learning modules. <br>

        Together, they explore the app, with Mia navigating through different sections and selecting activities that interest her. Tom guides Mia on how to set personalized learning goals and track her progress through the app's dashboard. As Mia engages with the learning modules, she begins to make choices on her own, selecting topics and setting the pace of her learning. Tom supports her by checking in on her progress and celebrating her achievements, fostering a sense of independence in Mia while ensuring she feels supported and encouraged in her learning journey.

    </p>




    <h2>Task Success Rate </h2> 

<p> This is a critical metric for evaluating whether users (students and parents) can successfully complete key tasks within the app, such as selecting reading material, customizing reading experiences, and completing writing exercises. <br> 

 A high task success rate indicates that the app's design and features are well-aligned with the needs of dyslexic learners, making educational content accessible and engaging. It reflects the app's usability in real-world scenarios, ensuring that users can benefit from its intended educational support.<br> 

Reading Comprehension Improvement: Measure the percentage increase in reading comprehension scores of dyslexic children after using the app for a specified period.<br>  

User Engagement Duration: Track the average time spent by dyslexic children on the app per session to assess engagement levels and overall interest. <br> 
</p>


<div><img width="25%" src="../images/graphic/xrppl.png" alt="" ></div> 

 <h2>Time-on-Task</h2> 

<p>Why Chosen: Time-on-task measures how long it takes for users to complete specific activities within the app, such as reading a story or finishing a set of writing exercises. This metric is important for understanding the efficiency of the app's design and interface, especially for dyslexic users who may need more time to process text. <br>

Measure of Success: Ideally, the app should help users complete tasks in a reasonable amount of time; neither too quickly, suggesting the task might be too easy or not engaging enough, nor too slowly, indicating potential usability issues or overly complex tasks. Optimizing time-on-task ensures that the app promotes a balanced pace of learning that accommodates the varied needs of dyslexic learners. <br>
</p>
 

<!-- <h2>User Satisfaction</h2> 

<p>Why Chosen: User satisfaction is a comprehensive metric that encompasses the overall user experience, including the app's ease of use, the effectiveness of its features, and the emotional response of users. Collecting feedback through surveys, interviews, and direct observations can provide insights into how users feel about the app, highlighting its strengths and areas for improvement. <br>

Measure of Success: High user satisfaction scores would indicate that the app is meeting or exceeding the expectations of dyslexic learners and their parents, contributing positively to the learning experience. It suggests that the app is not only usable but also enjoyable and valuable to its target audience, encouraging continued use and engagement with the educational content. <br> -->


</p>



    <h2>Solution:</h2>
        
        <p>In essence, this is not just about creating another dyslexia app; it's about redefining the learning landscape
            for dyslexic children by integrating cutting-edge technology in a way that has not been explored comprehensively
            before. <br>
            Through rigorous research and innovation, we aspire to make a meaningful contribution to the field of
            dyslexia support, offering a unique and effective solution that caters to the diverse needs of our target users.<br>
